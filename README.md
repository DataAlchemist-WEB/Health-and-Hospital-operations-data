# Health-and-Hospital-operations-data
This interactive visualization platform integrates critical data points: patient demographics, appointment statuses, treatment cost analysis, and resource allocation efficiency per doctor and branch, facilitating data-driven decision-making in healthcare management.

project objeecetive

 The primary objective of this project is to monitor and analyze the operational efficiency and patient metrics within a hospital or clinic system. The goal is to track appointment statuses, patient demographics, doctor performance, treatment costs, and payment methods to optimize resource allocation, reduce no-shows, and improve financial management.


QUESTIONS (KPI)
The dashboard is designed to track several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to answer critical operational and clinical questions:
•	Operational Efficiency: What is the ratio of completed appointments versus no-shows or cancelled appointments?
•	Resource Management: Which hospital branch is busiest? Which doctors have the most appointments?
•	Financial Health: What is the average treatment cost, total cost by treatment type, and common payment methods used?
•	Patient Demographics: What is the gender distribution of the patient base?

PROCESS

The image represents the final visualization and reporting stage of a data analysis project. The preceding steps would involve:
1.	Requirement Gathering: Defining what operational metrics the hospital administration needs to track.
2.	Data Collection & Cleaning: Gathering raw data from hospital information systems and ensuring its accuracy.
3.	Data Analysis & Modeling: Calculating metrics like averages, sums, and percentages using a business intelligence (BI) tool.
4.	Dashboard Creation: Visualizing the processed data into interactive charts and graphs for easy interpretation.
5.	
DASHBOARD PROJECT INSIGHT
•	High Completion Rate: A significant number of appointments are completed or scheduled, while a smaller portion are no-shows or cancelled.
•	Central Hospital is Busiest: The Central Hospital branch handles the highest volume of appointments.
•	Doctor Performance Variation: Doctor D005 has the most appointments (28), while D007 has the fewest (13), indicating varied caseloads.
•	Dominant Payment Method: Insurance (37.5%) and Cash (32%) are popular payment methods.
•	High Cost Treatments: Chemotherapy incurs the highest total sum of costs among the treatment types listed.

FINAL CONCLUSION
The data suggests an efficiently run operation with good tracking of patient flow and finances. The project likely concludes that while overall performance is solid, specific areas like reducing no-shows, balancing doctor caseloads, or analyzing cost drivers for chemotherapy could be areas for targeted improvements in future planning
